# Unit Test Coverage Matrix

This document encodes the project's expectations for unit test coverage by crate and module.
It prevents "test later" drift, keeps kernel invariants continuously verified, and makes CI
decisions explicit.

See Bead: bd-3hy.

## How to Use
- When adding a new module, add it here.
- When adding a new public API, add explicit unit tests here.
- CI should enforce these thresholds (see bd-xn2).

## Coverage Targets (v1)
- ftui-render: >= 85% (kernel)
- ftui-core: >= 80% (terminal/session + input)
- ftui-style: >= 80%
- ftui-text: >= 80%
- ftui-layout: >= 75%
- ftui-runtime: >= 75%
- ftui-widgets: >= 70%
- ftui-extras: >= 60% (feature-gated)

Note: Integration-heavy PTY tests are enforced separately; do not "unit test" around reality.

### Critical Gap: program.rs (34% coverage)
The core `Program` runtime loop has only 34% line coverage. The `run()` method requires
a real terminal for event polling. Coverage should be improved via `ProgramSimulator` tests
for Cmd handling, AppBuilder, and model lifecycle. Terminal I/O paths belong in PTY tests.

- [x] Harness-essential widgets have snapshot tests (renderable_snapshots.rs: 59+ tests)
- [x] Widgets: key unit tests (render + layout invariants) (frame_integration.rs + per-module)

## ftui-extras (>= 60%) — Actual: ~90%
- [x] Feature-gated modules include correctness tests (measured with `--all-features`)
- [ ] `image.rs` remains low coverage (46.46%) — add decode/format/error-path tests
- [ ] `pty_capture.rs` at 74.71% — add PTY integration scenarios for partial reads
