**Version 5.0 — Mathematical Core + Pragmatic Workspace Architecture (Ultimate Hybrid Plan)**

> Design goal: **scrollback-native, zero-flicker, agent-ergonomic, and high-performance** Rust terminal apps
> (agent harnesses, REPLs, dashboards, pagers) built on a *tiny sacred kernel* plus feature-gated layers.

# PART 0: EXECUTIVE BLUEPRINT

## 0.1 Executive Summary

FrankenTUI ("ftui") is a deliberately minimal, high-performance terminal UI kernel that fuses the best
surviving abstractions from three Rust codebases (rich_rust, charmed_rust, opentui_rust) into one coherent system.

This is **not** a 1:1 port, and it is **not** "a widget zoo." ftui is:
- **Inline-first** by default (native scrollback preserved)
- **Flicker-free by construction** (diffed, buffered, state-tracked output; synchronized output when available)
- **Deterministic and testable** (simulator + snapshot tests + PTY correctness tests)
- **Fast under real loads** (cache-local buffers, pooled graphemes, minimal ANSI churn)
- **Layered** so the kernel stays small and stable while widgets/extras can evolve rapidly

### Primary "real world" targets
- **Agent harness UIs**: Claude Code / Codex-style interactive sessions with:
  - streaming output (log area) + stable UI chrome (status/tool/inputs)
  - native scrollback (inline mode) + optional alt-screen
  - mouse + links + selections
  - no flicker, no cursor corruption, reliable cleanup on crash
- **Traditional TUIs**: dashboards, monitors, pickers, forms
- **Export / replay** (optional): capture frames or segment streams for HTML/SVG/text export and tests

## 0.2 Mission and Non-Goals

### Mission
- Create the smallest possible **kernel** that makes terminal apps *pleasant and robust*:
  - input → canonical events → (optional runtime) → frame → diff → minimal ANSI output
- Provide an API surface that is **agent-ergonomic**:
  - easy to stream logs while showing structured UI
  - easy to build components without fighting the renderer
- Make correctness **provable by tests**:
  - cursor policy, inline mode invariants, width correctness, diff correctness

### Non-goals (explicit)
- Backwards compatibility with upstream APIs (we keep concepts, not types)
- A monolithic crate bundling every widget and integration
- "Prove global minimal ANSI output for all cases"
  - We instead target: *minimal enough* (grouped writes, style-run grouping, state tracking) and
    validate via measurable output-size baselines.
- Full terminal emulation (we target output correctness for supported sequences)

## 0.3 The Three-Ring Architecture (Kernel → Widgets → Extras)

ftui is organized into three rings:

1) **Kernel (sacred)**: stable, minimal, deterministic
   - Frame/Buffer/Cell primitives
   - Diff engine
   - ANSI presenter (state tracked)
   - Input parser + canonical Event
   - Capability detection
   - Screen modes (Inline vs AltScreen) policy

2) **Widgets (reusable)**: built strictly on kernel primitives
   - Panels, lists, tables, viewports, inputs, text areas
   - Hit testing for mouse interaction

3) **Extras (feature-gated)**:
   - Markdown, syntax highlighting, forms, SSH/PTY integration, export (HTML/SVG), images (optional)

This separation ensures the kernel stays "obviously correct" while UX layers can evolve without destabilizing it.

## 0.4 Workspace Layout (Crates)

Use a workspace (recommended) to enforce layering boundaries:

1) `ftui-core`
   - Raw mode + terminal lifecycle guards (RAII)
   - Capability detection (env heuristics + optional queries)
   - Input parsing into canonical `Event`
   - Screen mode policy helpers (Inline/AltScreen)

2) `ftui-render`
   - `Cell`, `Buffer`, `Frame` (Frame = buffer + optional hit grid + metadata)
   - `GraphemePool`, `LinkRegistry`, optional `HitGrid`
   - Diff engine (cell-level scan + run grouping)
   - `Presenter` (ANSI writer, state tracked, single write per frame)
   - Optional `simd` feature (unsafe isolated)

3) `ftui-style`
   - Visual styling model (`TextStyle`, `CellStyle`, `Theme`, semantic colors)
   - Color downgrade (TrueColor → 256 → 16 → ASCII)
   - Deterministic style merge semantics (mask/props)

4) `ftui-text`
   - `Text`, `Span`, `Segment` (+ markup parser as optional)
   - Width measurement, wrapping, truncation, alignment
   - Caches (LRU widths) and grapheme segmentation helpers

5) `ftui-layout`
   - `Rect`, constraints, row/col/grid layout, measurement protocol

6) `ftui-runtime` (optional ring-2 "standard runtime")
   - Bubbletea/Elm-like `Program`, `Model`, `Cmd`, scheduler/ticks
   - Deterministic simulator

7) `ftui-widgets` (feature-gated)
   - Component library on top of kernel + style/text/layout

8) `ftui-extras` (feature-gated)
   - Markdown, syntax highlighting, export, SSH, forms, etc.

9) `ftui-harness` (examples / demos)
   - Agent harness reference implementation

## 0.5 Kernel Invariants (Must Always Hold)

- **All UI rendering is diffed and buffered** (Frame/Buffer → diff → presenter). No ad-hoc writes.
- **Inline mode never clears the full screen** (preserve scrollback). Only clears a bounded UI region.
- **Cursor correctness**: after any present(), cursor position is restored per the active policy.
- **Style correctness**: presenter never leaves terminal in a "dangling" style/link state after exit.
- **Width correctness**: grapheme width accounting is correct for all drawn glyphs (including ZWJ sequences).
- **Input parsing is lossless** for supported sequences and robust against malformed input (limits enforced).
- **Cleanup is guaranteed**: raw mode, cursor visibility, bracketed paste, mouse modes, alt screen are restored
  even on panic (panic hook + RAII guards).

## 0.6 Design Decisions to Lock Early (Decision Records / ADRs)

1) **Frame is the canonical render target**
   - Segment/text pipelines are intermediates; everything converges to Frame for diffing.

2) **Inline-first**
   - AltScreen is explicit, opt-in, and never required to use the library.

3) **Presenter emits grouped runs**
   - Changes are emitted in row-major runs (not per-cell cursor move) to reduce ANSI bytes and reduce flicker.

4) **Unsafe containment policy**
   - Default build uses fully safe scalar paths.
   - `simd` / "hot loops" can use unsafe but MUST be:
     - isolated in one module/crate
     - feature gated
     - tested + benchmarked
     - audited (document invariants; forbid "creative" unsafe)

5) **Style is split by responsibility**
   - `CellStyle` is tiny and renderer-facing (packed fg/bg/attrs/link-id).
   - Higher-level style (theme/semantic colors/layout) resolves into `CellStyle` before drawing.

## 0.7 Quality Gates (Stop-Ship if Failing)

- **Gate 1: Inline mode stability**
  - Re-rendering UI region while streaming logs cannot corrupt scrollback or cursor placement.

- **Gate 2: Diff/presenter correctness**
  - Property tests: applying presenter output to a terminal-model yields the expected grid for supported ops.

- **Gate 3: Unicode width correctness**
  - Test suite includes emoji/ZWJ/combining marks; no off-by-one wrapping errors allowed.

- **Gate 4: Terminal cleanup**
  - PTY tests verify raw mode + cursor visibility + alt screen restoration after normal exit and panic.

# PART I: FOUNDATIONS

## Chapter 1: First-Principles Derivation

### 1.1 What IS a Terminal?

A terminal is a **state machine** that transforms a stream of bytes into a visual grid of styled characters:

```
Terminal: (State, Byte*) → (State', Grid)
where:
  State = { cursor: (x,y), style: Style, mode: Mode, ... }
  Grid = Cell[width × height]
  Cell = { char: Grapheme, fg: Color, bg: Color, attrs: Attributes }
```

**Fundamental theorem**: Any terminal UI library is an **inverse function** — it must produce the minimal byte stream that transforms the current grid into the desired grid:

```
Render: (Grid_current, Grid_desired) → Byte*
such that Terminal(State, Render(G_c, G_d)) = (_, G_d)
```

This immediately implies (as a guiding principle):
1. **Diff-based rendering is optimal** — producing bytes for unchanged cells is wasteful
2. **State tracking is essential** — we must know the terminal's current state to emit minimal sequences
3. **Cell equality must be fast** — we compare O(w×h) cells per frame

⚠️ Practical note: "globally minimal" ANSI output is not always attainable without solving
hard sequencing problems (cursor moves, clears, style resets, terminal quirks).
ftui's objective is:
- **correct output**
- **bounded flicker**
- **near-minimal bytes** via:
  - row-major run grouping
  - style-run coalescing
  - state-tracked SGR and cursor position
  - heuristics (full redraw vs diff)

### 1.2 The Fundamental Operations

From first principles, a terminal UI library needs exactly these operations:

| Operation | Mathematical Model | Complexity Target |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Cell comparison** | `Cell × Cell → Bool` | O(1), < 1ns |
| **Cell mutation** | `Grid × (x,y) × Cell → Grid` | O(1), < 5ns |
| **Diff computation** | `Grid × Grid → [(x,y,Cell)]` | O(w×h), < 500µs for 80×24 |
| **ANSI emission** | `[(x,y,Cell)] → Byte*` | O(changes), minimal bytes |
| **Style composition** | `Style × Style → Style` | O(1), < 50ns |
| **Text measurement** | `String → usize` | O(graphemes), cached |
| **Grapheme interning** | `String → GraphemeId` | O(1) amortized |
| **Alpha blending** | `Rgba × Rgba → Rgba` | O(1), < 10ns |

### 1.3 The Optimality Conditions

A terminal UI library is **optimal** if and only if:

1. **Minimal output**: `|Render(G_c, G_d)| ≤ |Render'(G_c, G_d)|` for all alternative implementations
2. **Minimal computation**: Operations achieve their theoretical complexity bounds
3. **Minimal memory**: Data structures use asymptotically optimal space
4. **Minimal latency**: No unnecessary blocking or synchronization

**Corollary** (practical): the optimal architecture must:
- Use cell-level diffing (not region-level)
- Track terminal state to avoid redundant SGR codes
- Use bitwise cell comparison (not field-by-field)
- Cache computed values (widths, styles)
- Pool complex content (graphemes, links)

**Additional real-world constraints (often ignored by "optimal" proofs):**
- Terminals differ in support and correctness; we must feature-detect and provide fallbacks.
- "No flicker" depends on:
  - synchronized output support, and/or
  - a strict output policy (single buffered write per frame) and avoiding full-screen clears in inline mode.
- Robustness depends on cleanup discipline and crash recovery.

### 1.4 The Three-Library Synthesis

FrankenTUI extracts the optimal kernel from three Rust TUI libraries:

| Source | Contribution | Why Optimal |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **opentui_rust** | Cell grid, diff algorithm, alpha blending, scissor/opacity stacks, grapheme pool | Cache-optimal 16-byte cells, bitwise comparison, Porter-Duff compositing |
| **rich_rust** | Segment abstraction, markup parser, measurement protocol, Renderable trait, Live display | Cow<str> for zero-copy, event-driven span rendering, LRU width cache |
| **charmed_rust** | LipGloss styling, CSS-like properties, theme system, Elm architecture | Bitflags property tracking, shorthand tuple conversion, adaptive colors |

### 1.5 What Survives vs What Gets Dropped (Explicit)

This plan keeps only what strengthens the kernel:

**From opentui_rust (survives)**
- Cache-local buffers, pooled graphemes, scissor/opacity, alpha blending (opt-in)
- State-tracked ANSI presenter
- Input parsing patterns and safety limits
- Hit testing grid concept (mouse affordances)

**From rich_rust (survives)**
- Segment/text modeling and measurement protocol (min/max)
- Markup parsing (optional layer, not kernel)
- Export-friendly intermediate representations (Segments as optional output format)

**From charmed_rust (survives)**
- Bubbletea/Elm runtime model as an *optional* standard runtime crate
- Lipgloss-like ergonomics (builders), BUT with responsibility-separated structs
- Semantic theme slots and style inheritance semantics (explicit masks/props)

**Dropped / de-scoped from kernel**
- Widget zoo, markdown, syntax highlighting, forms: moved to feature-gated layers
- "View returns String" as the only API: supported via adapter, not as the core abstraction

=========================================================================
```

### 2.2 Rendering Pipeline State Machine

```
States: {Idle, Measuring, Rendering, Diffing, Presenting, Error}

Transitions:
  Idle --[render_request]--> Measuring
  Measuring --[layout_complete]--> Rendering
  Rendering --[draw_complete]--> Diffing
  Diffing --[diff_complete]--> Presenting
  Presenting --[present_complete]--> Idle
  * --[error]--> Error
  Error --[recover]--> Idle

Invariants:
  I1: In Rendering state, only back buffer is modified
  I2: In Presenting state, only ANSI output is produced
  I3: After Presenting, front buffer = desired grid
  I4: Error state restores terminal to safe state
  I5: Scissor stack intersection monotonically decreases on push
  I6: Opacity stack product stays in [0, 1]
```

### 2.3 Buffer Invariants (Formal)

```rust
/// INVARIANT: Buffer dimensions never change after creation
/// PROOF: width/height are immutable; cells vec size = width * height

/// INVARIANT: Cell access is always in bounds
/// PROOF: get/set check x < width && y < height; unchecked requires unsafe

/// INVARIANT: Scissor stack intersection is monotonically decreasing
/// PROOF: push() computes intersection; pop() restores previous (saved on stack)

/// INVARIANT: Opacity stack product is in [0, 1]
/// PROOF: values clamped on push; product = Π(stack) where each factor ∈ [0,1]

/// INVARIANT: GraphemePool slot.refcount > 0 implies slot is valid
/// PROOF: intern() sets refcount = 1; incref() adds 1; decref() only frees at 0

/// INVARIANT: Cell.content.Grapheme(id) implies id is valid in associated pool
/// PROOF: GraphemeId only created via pool.intern(); invalidation tracked
```

## Chapter 3: Cache Hierarchy Analysis

### 3.1 Memory Layout for Cache Efficiency

Modern CPUs have:
- **L1 cache**: 32-64 KB, ~4 cycles latency
- **L2 cache**: 256 KB - 1 MB, ~12 cycles
- **L3 cache**: 8-32 MB, ~40 cycles
- **Cache line**: 64 bytes

**Design implications**:

```
Cell = 16 bytes
  → 4 cells per cache line
  → 80×24 grid = 1920 cells = 30,720 bytes (fits in L1!)
  → 200×60 grid = 12000 cells = 192 KB (fits in L2)

Optimal access pattern:
  - Row-major iteration (cells[y * width + x])
  - Sequential scan for diff (no random access)
  - Prefetch next row while processing current
  - Avoid pointer chasing (use indices into arrays)
```

### 3.2 Cell Layout: The 16-Byte Sweet Spot

```rust
// OPTIMAL: 16 bytes, exactly 4 per 64-byte cache line
// Memory layout:
// ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
// │  content (4B)   │    fg (4B)      │    bg (4B)      │   attrs (4B)    │
// └─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
// Offset:  0              4                 8                 12

#[repr(C, align(16))]
pub struct Cell {
    content: CellContent,      // 4 bytes: char or GraphemeId
    fg: PackedRgba,            // 4 bytes: RGBA as u32
    bg: PackedRgba,            // 4 bytes: RGBA as u32
    attrs: CellAttrs,          // 4 bytes: flags (8 bits) + link_id (24 bits)
}

// WHY NOT 24 or 32 bytes?
// - 24 bytes: 2.67 cells/line, wastes 16 bytes per line
// - 32 bytes: 2 cells/line, doubles memory bandwidth
// - 16 bytes: Perfect fit, single SIMD comparison possible
```

### 3.3 Comparison: What We Avoid

```rust
// ❌ SUBOPTIMAL: 48+ bytes, heap allocations
pub struct CellBad {
    content: String,   // 24 bytes (ptr + len + cap) + HEAP
    fg: Rgba,          // 16 bytes (4 × f32)
    bg: Rgba,          // 16 bytes
    attrs: u64,        // 8 bytes
}
// Problems:
// - 1.3 cells per cache line
// - Heap allocation for every cell
// - Pointer chasing for content comparison

// ✅ OPTIMAL: 16 bytes, no heap for single chars
pub struct Cell {
    content: CellContent,  // Enum: Empty | Char(char) | Grapheme(GraphemeId)
    fg: PackedRgba,        // Packed u32
    bg: PackedRgba,        // Packed u32
    attrs: CellAttrs,      // Bitfield u32
}
// Benefits:
// - 4 cells per cache line
// - No heap for 99% of cells (ASCII/BMP chars)
// - Single 128-bit comparison
```

## Chapter 4: SIMD Opportunities

### 4.1 Where SIMD Helps

| Operation | SIMD Potential | Expected Speedup |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Cell comparison | 4 cells at once (64 bytes = 4×16) | 4× |
| Buffer clear | 256-bit writes | 8× |
| Color blending | 4 RGBA channels at once | 4× |
| ASCII width | 32 chars at once with AVX2 | 32× |
| Row copy | Entire rows with AVX-512 | 4× |

### 4.2 Cell Comparison with SIMD

```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]
use std::arch::x86_64::*;

/// Compare 4 cells at once (64 bytes) using AVX2
/// Returns bitmask where bit i is set if cells[i] differs
#[inline]
#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]
unsafe fn compare_cells_avx2(old: &[Cell; 4], new: &[Cell; 4]) -> u8 {
    // Load 64 bytes (4 cells) from each buffer
    let old_lo = _mm256_loadu_si256(old.as_ptr() as *const __m256i);
    let old_hi = _mm256_loadu_si256((old.as_ptr() as *const __m256i).add(1));
    let new_lo = _mm256_loadu_si256(new.as_ptr() as *const __m256i);
    let new_hi = _mm256_loadu_si256((new.as_ptr() as *const __m256i).add(1));

    // Compare 32 bytes at a time
    let cmp_lo = _mm256_cmpeq_epi64(old_lo, new_lo);
    let cmp_hi = _mm256_cmpeq_epi64(old_hi, new_hi);

    // Extract mask: 1 means equal
    let mask_lo = _mm256_movemask_epi8(cmp_lo) as u32;
    let mask_hi = _mm256_movemask_epi8(cmp_hi) as u32;

    // Convert to per-cell mask (4 bits for 4 cells)
    // Each cell is 16 bytes = 2 qwords, so check pairs
    let cell_mask =
        (((mask_lo & 0xFFFF) == 0xFFFF) as u8) |        // Cell 0
        ((((mask_lo >> 16) & 0xFFFF) == 0xFFFF) as u8) << 1 |  // Cell 1
        (((mask_hi & 0xFFFF) == 0xFFFF) as u8) << 2 |   // Cell 2
        ((((mask_hi >> 16) & 0xFFFF) == 0xFFFF) as u8) << 3;   // Cell 3

    // Invert: 1 means DIFFERENT
    !cell_mask & 0x0F
}

/// Scalar fallback for non-AVX2 systems (ALWAYS AVAILABLE)
#[inline]
fn compare_cells_scalar(old: &Cell, new: &Cell) -> bool {
    // Safe version: compare as 4 u32 values
    // Compiler can vectorize this
    old.content != new.content ||
    old.fg != new.fg ||
    old.bg != new.bg ||
    old.attrs != new.attrs
}
```

**NOTE ON UNSAFE POLICY:**
The plan originally used `unsafe` transmute/read for bitwise comparisons.
In ftui v5, we require:
- a safe default implementation (compiler can vectorize 4×u32 compares)
- optional `simd` feature uses isolated unsafe for AVX/SSE paths

This preserves Opus-level performance without making the whole codebase "unsafe by default".

### 4.3 ASCII Width with SIMD

```rust
/// Check if string is pure ASCII and return width in one pass
/// For ASCII, width = byte length (huge optimization)
#[cfg(all(target_arch = "x86_64", feature = "simd"))]
#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]
unsafe fn ascii_width_simd(s: &[u8]) -> Option<usize> {
    let len = s.len();
    let mut i = 0;

    // Process 32 bytes at a time
    let high_bit_mask = _mm256_set1_epi8(0x80u8 as i8);

    while i + 32 <= len {
        let chunk = _mm256_loadu_si256(s[i..].as_ptr() as *const __m256i);
        let high_bits = _mm256_and_si256(chunk, high_bit_mask);
        let any_high = _mm256_testz_si256(high_bits, high_bits);
        if any_high == 0 {
            return None;  // Non-ASCII byte found
        }
        i += 32;
    }

    // Handle remainder with scalar
    for &b in &s[i..] {
        if b & 0x80 != 0 { return None; }
    }

    Some(len)  // ASCII width = byte length
}

/// Safe scalar fallback (always available)
fn ascii_width_scalar(s: &[u8]) -> Option<usize> {
    if s.iter().all(|&b| b & 0x80 == 0) {
        Some(s.len())
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

### 9.3 Screen Modes: Inline-First vs AltScreen (Scrollback-Native)

FrankenTUI supports two output policies. **Inline is default.**

#### Inline mode (default)
Goals:
- preserve native scrollback
- allow an append-only log stream + a stable UI chrome region
- avoid full-screen clears
- maintain a strict cursor contract

Key idea:
- The application owns a bounded **UI Region** (typically bottom-anchored).
- Everything else is **Log Region** (append-only text written normally).

Inline mode contract:
1) ftui may move the cursor to draw the UI region.
2) ftui must restore the cursor to the "log cursor" after drawing.
3) ftui must never destroy existing scrollback by clearing the full screen.

Recommended inline present sequence:
1) Save cursor position (DECSC `ESC 7` or CSI s depending on terminal; prefer robust fallback)
2) Move cursor to UI anchor position (bottom-anchored: row = term_height - ui_height + 1)
3) Clear the UI region lines only (EL/ED localized clears)
4) Present the UI frame (diffed and buffered, ideally with sync output if supported)
5) Restore cursor position (DECRC `ESC 8` / CSI u)

Additional requirements:
- If the log stream writes while UI is visible, the library must:
  - temporarily clear/redraw the UI region, or
  - provide an API that centralizes all writing so the library can coordinate.

Practical API implication:
- Provide a single **TerminalWriter** that mediates:
  - `write_log(...)` (append-only)
  - `present_ui(frame)`
so UI+log cannot interleave uncontrolled.

#### AltScreen mode (opt-in)
Goals:
- classic full-screen TUI experience
- simplest cursor policy and less interaction with scrollback

AltScreen policy:
- Enter alt screen on start and leave on exit
- Full-screen clears allowed
- Cursor restoration policy is simpler; still enforce cleanup on panic

#### Mixed strategy
Many "agent harness" apps benefit from:
- Inline mode for logs + persistent scrollback
- A temporary alt-screen "modal" for complex interactions (pickers/forms)

This should be supported via:
- `ScreenMode::Inline`
- `ScreenMode::AltScreen`
- `ScreenMode::Inline { allow_modal_alt_screen: bool }`

### 9.4 tmux Detection and Passthrough

```rust
/// Check if running inside tmux
pub fn in_tmux() -> bool {
    std::env::var("TMUX").is_ok()
}

/// Wrap sequence for tmux passthrough
pub fn tmux_wrap(sequence: &str) -> String {
    if in_tmux() {
        // Double escapes for tmux
        let escaped = sequence.replace('\x1b', "\x1b\x1b");
        format!("\x1bPtmux;{}\x1b\\", escaped)
    } else {
        sequence.to_string()
    }
}
```

### 10.3 Input System Extensions (Optional, Feature-Gated)

The kernel input parser must remain small and robust. Additional capabilities can be layered:
- Kitty keyboard protocol decoding
- Clipboard events (where supported)
- Event coalescing:
  - mouse move floods
  - resize storms

Testing requirements:
- fuzz input parser with random byte streams
- hard bounds on CSI/OSC lengths are enforced
- no panics on malformed sequences

        }
    }
}

## Chapter 12: Runtime + Agent Harness API

### 12.1 Runtime Model (Bubbletea/Elm lineage, optional but recommended)

The kernel does not require a runtime. However, a standard runtime dramatically improves
agent-ergonomics and testability.

Core contract:
```rust
pub trait Model {
    type Message: From<Event> + Send + 'static;

    fn init(&mut self) -> Cmd<Self::Message> { Cmd::none() }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> Cmd<Self::Message>;

    fn view(&self, frame: &mut Frame);
}

pub enum Cmd<M> {
    None,
    Quit,
    Batch(Vec<Cmd<M>>),
    Sequence(Vec<Cmd<M>>),
    Msg(M),
    Tick(std::time::Duration),
    // Async is feature-gated: threadpool or tokio integration
}

impl<M> Cmd<M> {
    pub fn none() -> Self { Self::None }
    pub fn quit() -> Self { Self::Quit }
    pub fn batch(cmds: Vec<Self>) -> Self { Self::Batch(cmds) }
}
```

Program responsibilities:
- Own terminal lifecycle (raw mode, mouse modes, paste, focus, alt screen if enabled)
- Poll input → Event → Message
- Run update loop, schedule ticks/commands
- Render frames only when dirty (or on tick), with FPS cap if desired
- Enforce screen mode policy (Inline/AltScreen)

### 12.2 Deterministic Simulator (Stop regressions forever)

Provide `ProgramSimulator` that:
- injects a sequence of Events / Messages
- captures produced Frames (or buffer snapshots)
- enables snapshot tests for widgets and full apps
- runs without a real terminal (no flakiness)

```rust
pub struct ProgramSimulator<M: Model> {
    model: M,
    frames: Vec<Buffer>,
}

impl<M: Model> ProgramSimulator<M> {
    pub fn new(model: M) -> Self {
        Self { model, frames: Vec::new() }
    }

    pub fn inject_events(&mut self, events: &[Event]) {
        for event in events {
            let msg = M::Message::from(event.clone());
            self.model.update(msg);
        }
    }

    pub fn capture_frame(&mut self, width: u16, height: u16) -> &Buffer {
        let mut frame = Frame {
            buffer: Buffer::new(width, height),
            hit_grid: None,
            cursor_position: None,
            cursor_visible: true,
        };
        self.model.view(&mut frame);
        self.frames.push(frame.buffer);
        self.frames.last().unwrap()
    }
}
```

### 12.3 Minimal "String View" Adapter (Ergonomics)

Support trivial apps with:
```rust
fn view_string(&self) -> String
```
internally: String → Text/Segments → Frame draw → Presenter.

This keeps the kernel disciplined (Frame remains canonical) while preserving the "easy path."

### 12.4 Agent Harness Reference Implementation

```rust
use std::io::{self, Stdout, Write};

/// High-level coordinator for agent harness UIs
pub struct AgentHarness {
    session: TerminalSession<Stdout>,
    buffer: Buffer,
    prev_buffer: Buffer,
    presenter: Presenter<Stdout>,
    pool: GraphemePool,
    links: LinkRegistry,
    screen_mode: ScreenMode,
}

pub enum ScreenMode {
    Inline { ui_height: u16 },
    AltScreen,
}

impl AgentHarness {
    pub fn new(screen_mode: ScreenMode) -> io::Result<Self> {
        let (width, height) = terminal_size::terminal_size()
            .map(|(w, h)| (w.0, h.0))
            .unwrap_or((80, 24));

        let mut session = TerminalSession::new(io::stdout())?;
        session.enter_raw_mode()?;
        session.enable_mouse()?;
        session.enable_bracketed_paste()?;
        session.enable_focus_events()?;

        if matches!(screen_mode, ScreenMode::AltScreen) {
            session.enter_alt_screen()?;
        }

        let capabilities = session.capabilities().clone();

        Ok(Self {
            session,
            buffer: Buffer::new(width, height),
            prev_buffer: Buffer::new(width, height),
            presenter: Presenter::new(io::stdout(), capabilities),
            pool: GraphemePool::new(),
            links: LinkRegistry::new(),
            screen_mode,
        })
    }

    /// Present a frame (diff-based)
    pub fn present(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
        let diff = BufferDiff::compute(&self.prev_buffer, &self.buffer);
        self.presenter.present(&self.buffer, &diff, &self.pool, &self.links)?;
        std::mem::swap(&mut self.buffer, &mut self.prev_buffer);
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Write to log region (inline mode only)
    pub fn write_log(&mut self, text: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
        if let ScreenMode::Inline { ui_height } = self.screen_mode {
            // Save cursor, clear UI, write log, restore UI
            // This is simplified - real impl needs more care
            let stdout = io::stdout();
            let mut handle = stdout.lock();
            write!(handle, "\x1b7")?; // Save cursor
            write!(handle, "\x1b[{};1H", self.buffer.height() - ui_height)?;
            write!(handle, "\x1b[{}M", ui_height)?; // Delete UI lines
            write!(handle, "{}", text)?;
            write!(handle, "\x1b8")?; // Restore cursor
            handle.flush()?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn buffer_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Buffer {
        &mut self.buffer
    }

    pub fn grapheme_pool(&mut self) -> &mut GraphemePool {
        &mut self.pool
    }

    pub fn link_registry(&mut self) -> &mut LinkRegistry {
        &mut self.links
    }
}
```

## Chapter 13: Testing, Verification, and CI Gates

### 13.1 Unit + Property Tests (Kernel)

Kernel must be "boringly correct." Enforce:
- Unit tests:
  - Cell packing/eq
  - Buffer bounds + scissor/opacity invariants
  - Grapheme pool refcount correctness
  - Link registry correctness
- Property tests (randomized):
  - Diff correctness: applying changes reproduces target buffer
  - Presenter state tracking never emits malformed sequences
  - Width correctness: rendering never writes beyond frame bounds for random strings

### 13.2 Snapshot Tests (Widgets / Apps)

For widgets and runtime-driven apps:
- Snapshot Frame buffers (grid of Cells) across themes and widths
- Snapshot Segment streams for export pipelines
- Ensure deterministic outputs in simulator mode

### 13.3 PTY Integration Tests (Terminal Reality)

To validate "no flicker / no corruption" claims:
- spawn a PTY, run a minimal ftui app, capture terminal output
- assert:
  - cursor is restored after each present() in Inline mode
  - raw mode is restored on exit
  - cursor visibility restored (show cursor)
  - bracketed paste/mouse modes disabled on exit
  - alt screen exited on exit
- run tests for:
  - normal exit
  - panic during render
  - IO error mid-write

### 13.4 Fuzzing (Input Parser)

Fuzz `InputParser::parse` with random byte streams:
- no panics
- sequence length limits enforce bounds
- parser remains linear time for worst-case inputs

### 13.5 CI Enforcement

CI should enforce:
- clippy + fmt
- unit/property/snapshot/PTY tests
- performance benchmarks as baselines (non-blocking initially, but tracked)
- feature matrix build:
  - default (safe scalar)
  - +simd
  - +extras

### 13.6 Decision Gates (Operational)

- Gate 1: Inline stability demo + PTY tests passing
- Gate 2: Diff/presenter property tests passing
- Gate 3: Unicode width suite passing (ZWJ/emoji/combining)
- Gate 4: Cleanup discipline verified under panic

---

## Chapter 14: Migration Map and Integration Strategy

### 14.1 Migration Principles
- Extract primitives first (Cell/Buffer/Presenter/InputParser)
- Keep adapters for old abstractions short-lived
- Avoid widget ports until the kernel is stable (Gate 1-2)
- Treat "export" as an extra layer using Segment pipeline, not kernel

### 14.2 Source → ftui mapping (conceptual)

**opentui_rust → ftui-render / ftui-core**
- Buffer/Cell/GraphemePool → ftui-render
- Presenter/AnsiWriter → ftui-render
- Input parser + caps → ftui-core
- HitGrid → ftui-render (optional)

**rich_rust → ftui-text / ftui-style / ftui-extras**
- Segment/measurement/text → ftui-text
- Markup parser → ftui-text or ftui-extras (feature gated)
- Live hooks/export adapters → ftui-extras

**charmed_rust → ftui-runtime / ftui-style / ftui-widgets**
- Bubbletea runtime → ftui-runtime (optional but recommended)
- Lipgloss ergonomics → ftui-style (split responsibilities)
- Bubbles/widgets → ftui-widgets

### 14.3 Compatibility Strategy
- Keep terminal protocol support in kernel (caps + presenter)
- Keep UI-specific features (markdown/syntax/forms) in extras
- Maintain a reference "agent harness" app as the integration testbed

## Chapter 15: Implementation Roadmap (Phased, No Time Estimates)

### Phase 0: Contracts + Workspace Skeleton
- [ ] Establish workspace crate layout (ftui-core/render/style/text/layout/runtime/widgets/extras)
- [ ] Define public contracts for kernel types:
  - `Cell`, `Buffer`, `Frame`, `Presenter`, `TerminalSession`, `Event`
- [ ] Write ADRs for the locked decisions (Section 0.6)

**Exit criteria**: public API compiles; minimal demo crate prints a frame in Inline mode.

### Phase 1: Core Render Kernel
- [ ] `Cell` (16 bytes), `CellContent`, `CellAttrs`
- [ ] `PackedRgba` with Porter-Duff blending
- [ ] `GraphemeId`, `GraphemePool` with ref-counting
- [ ] `Buffer` with scissor/opacity stacks
- [ ] `Rect`, `Sides`, `Measurement`
- [ ] Unit tests for all types

**Exit criteria**: unit tests pass; scalar bits_eq is correct; buffer invariants enforced.

### Phase 2: Diff + Presenter (Near-minimal ANSI)
- [ ] `BufferDiff` with SIMD path (feature-gated)
- [ ] `Presenter` with state tracking
- [ ] `TerminalCapabilities` detection
- [ ] Synchronized output (DEC 2026)
- [ ] OSC 8 hyperlinks
- [ ] Panic hook installation
- [ ] Run grouping (row-major ChangeRuns) + style-run coalescing

**Exit criteria**: single-write-per-frame; run grouping works; inline demo shows no flicker on supported terminals.

### Phase 3: Input System
- [ ] Event types (Key, Mouse, Resize, Paste, Focus)
- [ ] `InputParser` state machine
- [ ] SGR mouse protocol
- [ ] Bracketed paste handling
- [ ] DoS protection limits
- [ ] Fuzz harness for parser

**Exit criteria**: parser passes fuzzing and deterministic tests for key/mouse/paste/resize.

### Phase 4: Styling (Split responsibilities)
- [ ] `Style` with bitflags property tracking
- [ ] CSS-like shorthand (Sides from tuples)
- [ ] `Color` enum with profile resolution
- [ ] `Theme` system with presets
- [ ] `Border` presets and custom
- [ ] Markup parser `[bold red]text[/]`
- [ ] Define `CellStyle` vs higher-level style resolution

**Exit criteria**: deterministic style merge + theme resolution; markup is correct under tests.

### Phase 5: Layout + Components (Widgets ring)
- [ ] `Renderable` trait
- [ ] `Panel` with borders and titles
- [ ] `Spinner` with multiple styles
- [ ] `Progress` bar
- [ ] `Text` with wrapping
- [ ] `Table` (basic)
- [ ] `Viewport` and `TextInput` (agent harness essentials)

**Exit criteria**: snapshot tests for widgets pass; hit testing works where applicable.

### Phase 6: Runtime + Agent Harness Reference App
- [ ] Implement `Program` + `Model` + `Cmd` + scheduler (ftui-runtime)
- [ ] Implement `ProgramSimulator`
- [ ] Build `ftui-harness` reference app:
  - inline scrollback log stream + UI region
  - tool indicators, status line, input area
  - streaming render updates
  - no flicker, no corruption

**Exit criteria**: harness demo passes PTY tests; inline mode is stable under sustained output.

### Phase 7: Extras + Polish
- [ ] Documentation (rustdoc)
- [ ] Examples gallery
- [ ] Performance audit
- [ ] Terminal compatibility testing
- [ ] CI/CD setup
- [ ] Export adapters (Segment/HTML/SVG) feature-gated
- [ ] Optional syntax highlighting/markdown feature-gated

**Exit criteria**: stable kernel API; docs + examples; performance baselines recorded; compatibility matrix validated.

Inline mode notes:
- Inline mode works everywhere but depends on a correct cursor-save/restore strategy.
- Sync output is a best-effort optimization where supported; inline correctness must not depend on it.

## Appendix C: Risk Register (Top Risks + Mitigations)

1) **Inline mode cursor corruption**
   - Mitigation: PTY tests + strict cursor policy + centralized writer API for logs/UI.

2) **Unicode width bugs**
   - Mitigation: curated test corpus + snapshot tests + avoid "byte length == width" except proven ASCII fast path.

3) **Terminal capability mismatches**
   - Mitigation: conservative defaults + feature detection + robust fallbacks; never assume sync output.

4) **Unsafe creep**
   - Mitigation: feature-gated simd module, documented invariants, safe default always available.

5) **Presenter byte bloat**
   - Mitigation: run grouping + style-run coalescing + output-length benchmarks in CI.

6) **Interleaved stdout writes from user code**
   - Mitigation: provide a `TerminalSession`/`TerminalWriter` API and recommend exclusive ownership patterns.

## Appendix D: Extracted Library Implementations

This appendix contains detailed code extractions from the three source libraries that form the basis of FrankenTUI's design.

### D.1 From rich_rust: Segment System

The Segment is the atomic unit of styled text. Key insight: use `Cow<str>` to avoid allocation when borrowing.

```rust
/// Atomic rendering unit - styled text slice
/// From rich_rust/src/segment.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct Segment<'a> {
    pub text: Cow<'a, str>,              // Borrowed when possible
    pub style: Option<Style>,
    pub control: Option<SmallVec<[ControlCode; 2]>>,  // Stack-allocated for 0-2 codes
}

/// Control codes for cursor/screen manipulation
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum ControlType {
    Bell = 1,
    CarriageReturn = 2,
    Home = 3,
    Clear = 4,
    ShowCursor = 5,
    HideCursor = 6,
    EnableAltScreen = 7,
    DisableAltScreen = 8,
    CursorUp = 9,
    CursorDown = 10,
    CursorForward = 11,
    CursorBack = 12,
    CursorNextLine = 13,
    CursorPrevLine = 14,
    EraseLine = 15,
    SetTitle = 16,
}

impl<'a> Segment<'a> {
    /// Split segment at cell position (not byte position!)
    /// Critical for correct text wrapping with wide chars
    pub fn split_at_cell(&self, cell_pos: usize) -> (Self, Self) {
        if self.is_control() {
            return (self.clone(), Self::default());
        }

        let mut width = 0;
        let mut byte_pos = 0;

        for (i, c) in self.text.char_indices() {
            let char_width = unicode_width::UnicodeWidthChar::width(c).unwrap_or(0);
            if width + char_width > cell_pos {
                break;
            }
            width += char_width;
            byte_pos = i + c.len_utf8();
        }

        // Optimized split using Cow to avoid unnecessary allocation
        let (left, right) = match &self.text {
            Cow::Borrowed(s) => {
                let (l, r) = s.split_at(byte_pos);
                (Cow::Borrowed(l), Cow::Borrowed(r))
            }
            Cow::Owned(s) => {
                let (l, r) = s.split_at(byte_pos);
                (Cow::Owned(l.to_string()), Cow::Owned(r.to_string()))
            }
        };

        (
            Self::new(left, self.style.clone()),
            Self::new(right, self.style.clone()),
        )
    }

    /// Cell width (display width, not byte length)
    pub fn cell_length(&self) -> usize {

        unicode_width::UnicodeWidthStr::width(self.text.as_ref())
    }
}
```

### D.2 From rich_rust: Markup Parser

Regex-based parser for Rich-style markup like `[bold red]text[/]`.

```rust

        if num_backslashes > 0 {

            current_text.push_str(tag_content);
            current_text.push(']');
        } else {

            if !current_text.is_empty() {
                let style = style_stack.last().map(|(_, s)| s.clone());
                segments.push(Segment::new(
                    Cow::Owned(std::mem::take(&mut current_text)),
                    style,
                ));
            }

            // Process tag

                if style_stack.len() > 1 {
                    style_stack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                // Opening tag: push new style
                let new_style = parse_style_tag(&tag, style_stack.last().map(|(_, s)| s));
                style_stack.push((segments.len(), new_style));
            }
        }

        last_end = full_match.end();
    }

    // Remaining text
    if last_end < markup.len() {
        current_text.push_str(&markup[last_end..]);
    }
    if !current_text.is_empty() {
        let style = style_stack.last().map(|(_, s)| s.clone());

## Conclusion

FrankenTUI v5.0 represents an "ultimate hybrid" synthesis of three excellent terminal UI libraries:

1. **From opentui_rust**: Cache-optimal 16-byte cells, bitwise comparison, Porter-Duff blending, grapheme pooling, scissor/opacity stacks, cell-level diffing

2. **From rich_rust**: Cow<str> segments for zero-copy, regex-based markup parser, event-driven span rendering, LRU width caching, measurement protocol

3. **From charmed_rust**: Bitflags property tracking for inheritance, CSS-like tuple shorthand, adaptive colors, border presets, color profile detection

The result is a **scrollback-native, zero-flicker, agent-ergonomic** terminal UI library plan that is:
- mathematically grounded (cell+diff model)
- operationally realistic (inline cursor policies, run grouping, fallbacks)
- test-driven (property + snapshot + PTY + fuzz)
- layered for long-term maintainability (kernel/widgets/extras)

Performance targets:
- **< 1ns** cell comparison (bitwise)
- **< 500µs** frame diff (80×24)
- **< 1ms** total frame time
- **16 bytes** per cell (4 cells per cache line)
- **Zero heap allocation** for 99% of cells

*FrankenTUI: Where rigor meets practical ergonomics.*
